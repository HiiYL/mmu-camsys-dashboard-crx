MMU CaMSys Dashboard
====================

(Google Chrome browser extension)

For Student account only.

CaMSys Dashboard adds a dashboard view feature into CaMSys.
It grabs and places student's frequently viewed information (Attendance, Schedule, Finance, Advisor) onto the dashboard.
The dashboard layout focuses on information and simplicity, combined with a vibrant design.

FEATURES:
- Print class schedule
- Convert new venue codes to old codes (CQAR2003 to FIT AR2003)

Notice:
- Venue codes for Melaka campus cannot be converted to old, as I'm not familiar with Melaka venue codes
